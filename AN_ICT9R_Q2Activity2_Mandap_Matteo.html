<p class="para1">
        Because I could not stop for Death – <br>
        He kindly stopped for me –<br>
        The Carriage held but just Ourselves –<br>
        And Immortality.<br>
</p>
<p id="para2">
        We slowly drove – He knew no haste<br>
        And I had put away<br>
        My labor and my leisure too,<br>
        For His Civility –<br>
</p>
<p>
        We passed the School, where Children strove<br>
        At Recess – in the Ring –<br>
        We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –<br>
        We passed the Setting Sun -<br>
</p>
<p>
        Or rather – He passed Us –<br>
        The Dews drew quivering and Chill –<br>
        For only Gossamer, my Gown –<br>
        My Tippet – only Tulle –<br>
</p>
<p>
        We paused before a House that seemed<br>
        A Swelling of the Ground –<br>
        The Roof was scarcely visible –<br>
        The Cornice – in the Ground –<br>
</p>
<p>
        Since then – 'tis Centuries – and yet<br>
        Feels shorter than the Day<br>
        I first surmised the Horses' Heads<br>
        Were toward Eternity –<br>
