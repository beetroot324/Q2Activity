	<p>Stop thinking of this as being money</p> <br> 

	<p>It's just money, I'ma make more</p> <br> 

	<p>No, no no no no no</p> <br> 
	<p>Please de-condition yourself</p> <br> 

	<p>It's not just money</p> <br> 

	<p>It's happiness</p> <br> 

	<p>It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad</p> <br> 

	<p>It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets</p> <br> 

	<p>That's what it is, it's not just money</p> <br> 

	<p>It's so much more than that</p> <br> 

	<p>Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom</p> <br> 

	<p>And disappointing a girl</p> <br> 

	<p>As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money</p> <br> 

	<p>I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you</p> <br> 

	<p>Absolutely nothing</p> <br> 

	<p>Let's see, I have</p> <br> 

	<p>Ooh yeah, I'ma make myself a hot link when I get home</p> <br> 

	<p>It meant nothing to you</p> <br> 

	<p>Savin' my seven dollars</p> <br>
