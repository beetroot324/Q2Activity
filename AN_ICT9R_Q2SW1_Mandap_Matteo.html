<ul><li> <font size="+3">The American Bully is distinguished by a short, close, stiff to the touch, and glossy coat. Colors and patterns of any kind are welcome. The American Bully has a large skull that is medium in length. It also has prominent cheek muscles, a definite stop, and high-set ears. It is possible to have the ears cropped or left unclipped. In general, American Bullies are friendly, outgoing, secure, and assured canines. Mild-mannered and empathetic toward others. A loving companion who is also a good sport and a lot of fun to be around. This dog is extremely obedient and will do anything for its master. It's a guard dog par excellence, one that is both brave and bright and has a ton of energy.</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size="+3">A small dog with a big square head and a rounded forehead characterizes the French Bulldog. There is a sharp halt at the end of the broad, deep muzzle. Even in dogs of milder coat colors, the nose is always black. French Bulldogs are easy-care, energetic, attentive, and affectionate. It's vibrant and eager without being loud. It's curious, funny, and loves to fool around. It's lighthearted. The Frenchie likes strangers and other animals and its owner. It's good with dogs. Frenchies who think they're alpha may be dog hostile.</font></li></ul>

<ul><li><font size="+3">English and American Labradors exist. The Lab is English-bred. It looks distinct from American-bred Labs. English Labs are thicker, heavier, and blockier. American-bred Labs are tall and lanky. The double coat is waveless. Labrador Retrievers are loyal, affectionate, and patient, making them wonderful family dogs. It's a highly clever, good-natured, eager-to-please service dog. Labs love to swim and play in the water. These affable, trustworthy canines are great with kids and other dogs.</font></li></ul></td>
